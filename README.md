## Introduction

Account abstraction is a powerful concept in Ethereum that aims to simplify user interactions with the blockchain. By allowing different types of accounts and transactions, it provides flexibility and enhances security. This repository contains demos that help developers and enthusiasts understand and experiment with these concepts.

## What is Account Abstraction?

Account abstraction separates the logic of transaction signing from the account itself. This means that developers can create custom transaction types and account behaviors without being limited by the traditional Ethereum account model. Key benefits include:

- **Enhanced User Experience**: Users can interact with smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) more easily.
- **Increased Security**: Custom signing logic can help protect against various attack vectors.
- **Flexibility**: Developers can implement new features and behaviors without changing the underlying protocol.

### Key Standards

- **EIP-7702**: This proposal outlines a standard for account abstraction on Ethereum.
- **ERC-4337**: This standard focuses on the implementation of smart accounts and how they interact with dApps.
- **ERC-7710** and **ERC-7715**: These proposals provide additional functionalities and improvements for account abstraction.

## Demos Overview

This repository includes several demos that illustrate the principles of account abstraction. Each demo focuses on a specific aspect or use case, making it easier for you to understand the concepts. Here are some highlights:

1. **Smart Account Demo**: A demonstration of a smart account that utilizes custom logic for transaction signing.
2. **Paymaster Example**: This demo shows how a paymaster can facilitate gas payments for users, enhancing the overall user experience.
3. **Bundler Implementation**: An example of how to bundle multiple transactions into a single operation, reducing costs and improving efficiency.

## Installation

To get started with the demos, you need to clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohammadali4542/account-abstraction-demos.git
cd account-abstraction-demos
npm install
```

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download them from the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

## Usage

After installing the dependencies, you can run the demos locally. Each demo has its own instructions, but generally, you can start a demo with the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This command will launch a local server, and you can access the demo in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

For specific demos, check the README files within each demo folder for more detailed instructions.
